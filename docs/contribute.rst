How to contribute
===================


Reporting issues and submitting proposals
------------------------------------------

Found a bug? Let us know. 

Got an idea for a feature? Let's discuss it. 

This is the place for it: https://bitbucket.org/zalew/django-flickr/issues


Committing code
--------------

Non-breaking changes are welcome, just explicitely explain (in your commit message and/or pull request) what you did and why - it increases the chance your improvement gets merged upstream. Provide tests, make sure all tests pass, the build works, etc. 

If you developped or want to develop a new feature, just show the code and/or submit a proposal. Explain the idea behind it and use cases.

As always, the best place for open discussion is: https://bitbucket.org/zalew/django-flickr/issues
